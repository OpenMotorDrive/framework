"",Comment,"This feature is not supported for the FTS product variant.This message allows the user to alter the rate at which navigation solutions (and themeasurements that they depend on) are generated by the receiver. The calculation of thenavigation solution will always be aligned to the top of a second zero (first second of theweek) of the configured reference time system.For protocol version 18 and later the navigation period is an integer multiple of themeasurement period.•Each measurement triggers the measurements generation and raw data output.•The navRate value defines that every nth measurement triggers a navigation epoch.•The update rate has a direct influence on the power consumption. The more fixes thatare required, the more CPU power and communication resources are required.•For most applications a 1 Hz update rate would be sufficient.•When using Power Save Mode, measurement and navigation rate can differ from thevalues configured here. See Measurement and navigation rate with Power Save Modefor details.",,,,,
