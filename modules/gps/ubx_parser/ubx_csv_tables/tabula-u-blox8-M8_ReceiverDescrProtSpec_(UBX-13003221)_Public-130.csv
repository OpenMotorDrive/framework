"",Comment,"This message is used to report information about the logging subsystem.Note:•The reported maximum log size will be smaller than that originally specified inLOG-CREATE due to logging and filestore implementation overheads.•Log entries are compressed in a variable length fashion, so it may be difficult to predictlog space usage with any precision.•There may be times when the receiver does not have an accurate time (e.g. if the weeknumber is not yet known), in which case some entries will not have a timestamp. Thismay result in the oldest/newest entry time values not taking account of these entries.",,,,,
