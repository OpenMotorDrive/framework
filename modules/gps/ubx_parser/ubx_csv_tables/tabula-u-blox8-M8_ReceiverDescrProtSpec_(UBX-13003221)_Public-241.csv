"",Firmware,"Supported on:â€¢u-blox 8 / u-blox M8 from protocol version 18 up to version 23.01",,,,,
"",Type,Periodic/Polled,,,,,
"",Comment,"This message shows the IMES stations the receiver is currently tracking, their data rate, thesignal level, the Doppler (with respect to 1575.4282MHz) and what data (without protocolspecific overhead) it has received from these stations so far.This message is sent out at the navigation rate the receiver is currently set to. Therefore itallows users to get an overview on the receiver's current state from the IMES perspective.",,,,,
