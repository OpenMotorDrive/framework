0,R8,-,rcvTow,s,"Measurement time of week in receiver localtime approximately aligned to the GPS timesystem. The receiver local time of week, weeknumber and leap second information can beused to translate the time to other time systems.More information about the difference in timesystems can be found in RINEX 3documentation. For a receiver operating inGLONASS only mode, UTC time can bedetermined by subtracting the leapS field fromGPS time regardless of whether the GPS leapseconds are valid.",
