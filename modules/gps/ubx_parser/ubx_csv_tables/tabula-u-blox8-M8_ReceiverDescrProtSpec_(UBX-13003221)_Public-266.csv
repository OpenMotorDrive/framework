"",Comment,"This message can be sent by the host to force the receiver to bypass the discipliningalgorithms in the SMGR and carry out the instructed changes to internal or externaloscillator frequency. No checks are carried out on the size of the frequency changerequested, so normal limits imposed by the SMGR are ignored.It is recommended that the disciplining of that oscillator is disabled before this message issent (i.e. by clearing the enableInternal or enableExternal flag in the CFG-SMGR message),otherwise the autonomous disciplining processes may cancel the effect of the directcommand.Note that the GNSS subsystem may temporarily lose track of some/all satellite signals if alarge change of the internal oscillator is made.",,,,,
