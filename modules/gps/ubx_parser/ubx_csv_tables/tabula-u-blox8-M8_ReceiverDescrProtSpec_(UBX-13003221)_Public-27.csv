"",Comment,"All UBX-AID messages are deprecated; use UBX-MGA messages insteadThis message contains position, time and clock drift information. The position can be inputin either the ECEF X/Y/Z coordinate system or as lat/lon/height. The time can either be inputas inexact value via the standard communication interface, suffering from latencydepending on the baud rate, or using hardware time synchronization where an accuratetime pulse is input on the external interrupts. It is also possible to supply hardwarefrequency aiding by connecting a continuous signal to an external interrupt.",,,,,
