"",Comment,"Gets or sets the GNSS system channel sharing configuration.If the receiver is sent a valid new configuration, it will respond with a UBX-ACK-ACKmessage and immediately change to the new configuration. Otherwise the receiver willreject the request, by issuing a UBX-ACK-NAK and continuing operation with the previousconfiguration.Configuration requirements:•It is necessary for at least one major GNSS to be enabled, after applying the newconfiguration to the current one.•It is also required that at least 4 tracking channels are available to each enabled majorGNSS, i.e. maxTrkCh must have a minimum value of 4 for each enabled major GNSS.•The number of tracking channels in use must not exceed the number of trackingchannels available in hardware, and the sum of all reserved tracking channels needs tobe less than or equal to the number of tracking channels in use.Notes:•To avoid cross-correlation issues, it is recommended that GPS and QZSS are always bothenabled or both disabled.•Polling this message returns the configuration of all supported GNSS, whether enabledor not; it may also include GNSS unsupported by the particular product, but in suchcases the enable flag will always be unset.•See section GNSS Configuration for a discussion of the use of this message and sectionSatellite Numbering for a description of the GNSS IDs available.•Configuration specific to the GNSS system can be done via other messages (e.g.UBX-CFG-SBAS).",,,
