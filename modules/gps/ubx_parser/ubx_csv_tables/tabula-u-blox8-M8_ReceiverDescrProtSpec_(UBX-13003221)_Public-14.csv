"",Comment,"All UBX-AID messages are deprecated; use UBX-MGA messages instead•If the WEEK Value is 0, DWRD0 to DWRD7 are not sent as the Almanac is not availablefor the given SV. This may happen even if NAV-SVINFO and RXM-SVSI are indicatingalmanac availability as the internal data may not represent the content of an originalbroadcast almanac (or only parts thereof).•DWORD0 to DWORD7 contain the 8 words following the Hand-Over Word ( HOW )from the GPS navigation message, either pages 1 to 24 of sub-frame 5 or pages 2 to 10of subframe 4. See IS-GPS-200 for a full description of the contents of the Almanacpages.•In DWORD0 to DWORD7, the parity bits have been removed, and the 24 bits of data arelocated in Bits 0 to 23. Bits 24 to 31 shall be ignored.•Example: Parameter e (Eccentricity) from Almanac Subframe 4/5, Word 3, Bits 69-84within the subframe can be found in DWRD0, Bits 15-0 whereas Bit 0 is the LSB.",,,,,
