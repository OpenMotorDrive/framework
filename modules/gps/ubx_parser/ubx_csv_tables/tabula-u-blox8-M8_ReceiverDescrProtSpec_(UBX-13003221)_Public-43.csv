Otherwise the receiver willreject the request, by issuing a UBX-ACK-NAK and continuing operation with the previousconfiguration.Note that the acknowledge message does not indicate whether the PIO configuration hasbeen successfully applied (pin assigned), it only indicates the successful configuration of thefeature. The configured PIO must be previously unoccupied for successful assignment.",,,,,
