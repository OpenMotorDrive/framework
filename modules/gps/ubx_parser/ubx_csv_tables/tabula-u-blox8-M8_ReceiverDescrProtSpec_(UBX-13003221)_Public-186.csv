"",Comment,"Status of different aspects of the hardware such as Imbalance, Low-Level Configurationand POST Results.The first four parameters of this message represent the complex signal from the RF frontend. The following rules of thumb apply:•The smaller the absolute value of the variable ofsI and ofsQ, the better.•Ideally, the magnitude of the I-part (magI) and the Q-part (magQ) of the complex signalshould be the same.",,,,,
