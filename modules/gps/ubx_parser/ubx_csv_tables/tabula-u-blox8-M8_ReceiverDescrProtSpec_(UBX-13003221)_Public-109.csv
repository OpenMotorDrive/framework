Comment,"This message outputs information about vehicle dynamics computed by the InertialNavigation System (INS) during ESF-based navigation.For ADR products, the output dynamics information (angular rates and accelerations) isexpressed with respect to the vehicle-frame. More information can be found in the ADRNavigation Output section.For UDR products, the output dynamics information (angular rates and accelerations) isexpressed with respect to the body-frame. More information can be found in the UDRNavigation Output section.",,,,,
