"",Comment,"Several configurations can be concatenated to one input message. In this case the payloadlength can be a multiple of the normal length (see the other versions of CFG-PRT). Outputmessages from the module contain only one configuration unit.Note that this message can affect baud rate and other transmission parameters. Becausethere may be messages queued for transmission there may be uncertainty about whichprotocol applies to such messages. In addition a message currently in transmission may becorrupted by a protocol change. Host data reception paramaters may have to be changedto be able to receive future messages, including the acknowledge message resulting fromthe CFG-PRT message.",,,,,
