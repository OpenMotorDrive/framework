"",Comment,"This message is sent when the oscillator gain calibration process is finished (successful orunsuccessful). It notifies the user of the calibrated oscillator gain. If the oscillator gaincalibration process was successful, this message will contain the measured gain (fieldgainVco) and its uncertainty (field gainUncertainty). The calibration process can howeverfail. In that case the two fields gainVco and gainUncertainty are set to zero.",,,,,
