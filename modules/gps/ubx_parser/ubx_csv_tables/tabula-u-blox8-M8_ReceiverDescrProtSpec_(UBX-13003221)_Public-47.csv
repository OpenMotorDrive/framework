"",Comment,"The u-blox receivers support high rates of navigation update up to 30 Hz. The navigationsolution output (NAV-HNR) will not be aligned to the top of a second.•The update rate has a direct influence on the power consumption. The more fixes thatare required, the more CPU power and communication resources are required.•For most applications a 1 Hz update rate would be sufficient.",,,,,
