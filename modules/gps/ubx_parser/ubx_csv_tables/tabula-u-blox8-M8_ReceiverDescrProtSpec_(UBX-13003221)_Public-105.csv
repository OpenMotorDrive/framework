"",Comment,"This message configures how transmit time slots are defined for the receiver interfaces.These time slots are relative to the chosen time pulse. A receiver that supports this messageoffers 3 time slots: nr. 0, 1 and 2. These time pulses follow each other and their associatedpriorities decrease in this order. The end of each can be specified in this message, thebeginning is when the circularly previous slot ends (i.e. slot 0 starts when slot 2 finishes).",,,,,
