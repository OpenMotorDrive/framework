"",Comment,"This message is used to transfer a block of MGA-ANO data from host to the receiver. Uponreception of this message, the receiver will write the payload data to its internalnon-volatile memory (flash). Also, on reception of the first MGA-FLASH-DATA message, thereceiver will erase the flash allocated to storing any existing MGA-ANO data. The payloadcan be up to 512 bytes. Payloads larger than this would exceed the receiver's internalbuffering capabilities. The receiver will ACK/NACK this message using the messagealternatives given below. The host shall wait for an acknowledge message before sendingthe next data block. See Flash-based AssistNow Offline for details.",,,,,
